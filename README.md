# parkadoo

## What is parkadoo?
This is an experimental project to help people understand Edmonton parking laws better and create a letter that can help with the appeal process.

## How to set up

1. Clone git repository
2. Navigate to project folder and run ```npm start``` to start a local server
3. View on localhost

## Philosphy

- Goal was to reduce external dependencies as much as possible. Uses vanilla JS, CSS, HTML
- Uses es6 modules so needs a local server to run while developing
- User data is not collected and user answers are saved only to their device and clears after their browsing session ends
